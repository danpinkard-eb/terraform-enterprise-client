# Terraform Enterprise API Client & Command Line Tool
A simple Ruby API client library and command line tool for the [Terraform Enterprise API](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/api/index.html).



## Requirements

MRI Ruby 2.0 and newer are supported. Alternative interpreters compatible with 2.0+ should work as well.

Earlier Ruby versions such as 1.8.7, 1.9.2, and 1.9.3 may work but are not supported.

This gem depends on these other gems for usage at runtime:

- [rest-client](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client)
- [colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize)
- [thor](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor)

## API Client

### Usage



#### Basic Example

```ruby
require 'terraform-enterprise-client'

api_key = ENV['TERRAFORM_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN']
client = TerraformEnterprise::Client.new(api_key: api_key)

# Create a new organization
org = client.organizations.create(name:'my-org',email:'maciej@skierkowski.com')

# Create a new workspace in the new organization.
# Uses the same parameters as the following docs:
# https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/api/workspaces.html
client.workspaces.create(name:'my-new-workspace', organization:'my-org')

# Delete the workspace
client.workspaces.delete(name:'my-new-workspace', organization: 'my-org')

# Delete the organization now that we are done
client.organizations.delete(name:'my-org')
```



### Configuration

There are two main settings that can be modified on initialization:

- `:api_key` (required) - which specifies the API key (formerly called ATLAS_TOKEN)
- `:host` - a hostname other than the default (`app.terraform.io`) for usage with private installs

### Resources

The number of supported resources is a subset of the resources exposed via the Terraform Enterprise API. Additional resources will be added in future releases. Current supported resources include:

- `Client#workspaces`
- `Client#organizations`
- `Client#oauth_tokens`

## Command Line Tool

Installing the gem installs the `tfe` command line tool. Running `tfe help` provides the help information and list of available subcomands.

### Usage

All of the resources, actions and paraeters are documented in the tool and available through the `help` subcommand.

#### Basic Usage
```shell
âž­ tfe help
Commands:
  tfe help [COMMAND]              # Describe available commands or one specific command
  tfe oauth_tokens <subcommand>   # Manage OAuth tokens
  tfe organizations <subcommand>  # Manage organizations
  tfe workspaces <subcommand>     # Manage workspaces
```
